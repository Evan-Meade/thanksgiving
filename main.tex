		When I was in charge of the cooking for Friendsgiving back in 2023, I had compiled a bunch of notes and recipes through my planning, but they weren't very organized. In an effort to make things easier for myself and others in the future, I took some time on lazy afternoons the following summer to consolidate and clean up those notes here. Although the presentation is quite formal, my hope is that this guide isn't taken \textit{too} seriously. Readers should feel free to swap recipes or dishes or schedules as they see fit; most of those presented here are just taken from other people anyways and could probably be improved upon (though I am quite proud of my own cranberry sauce recipe, see Sec.~\ref{sec:cranberry_sauce}). I'd say the most useful part of this whole guide is the oven/cooktop schedule in Sec.~\ref{sec:oven_schedule}. It provides a pretty neat arrangement of items grouped by temperature and time so that you can make a full feast with only a single standard, two-rack oven. But again, even this can be totally changed depending on your menu. The other main takeaway is just how many things can be made ahead of time (see Sec.~\ref{sec:prep_schedule}). So even if you are just one person, you can make most things over the couple evenings leading up to the big day, though obviously it's even faster with help. Overall, while it definitely requires a fair amount of planning and preparation, don't stress out over a Thanksgiving feast. Ultimately, it's just an excuse to get people together, and the food is just gravy, so to speak.

	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
	Thanksgiving can be a lovely day with a lovely meal, but it can just as easily be a stressful mess. This year, almost a dozen of my friends will be descending on Dallas with a taste for turkey (or tofurkey). Yet all we have in the way of a kitchen is our Airbnb's amenities and my small apartment. As the proverbial "Chef," I am duty bound to engineer a solution to this constrictive plight. I knew if I was going to have any chance of satiating these starving souls I'd need to plan Turkey day like a heist: craft a master plan and recruit a crack team to execute it without a trace. I'll try to avoid the mandatory mid-heist betrayal because, c'mon, it's Thanksgiving gosh darn it.
	
	I first did some \href{https://www.foodandwine.com/how/thanksgiving-dishes-make-ahead-advance-sides}{research} on what can be made ahead of time and what can't. Make aheads include:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Desserts
		\item Stuffing
		\item Gravy (you'll see)
		\item Casseroles
		\item Prep work (cutting vegetables, brining turkey, etc.)
	\end{itemize}
	
	Things to make a la minute include:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Cook the turkey
		\item Roast/saute vegetables
		\item Salad
		\item Starches (potatoes, breads, etc.)
	\end{itemize}
	
	This was a good sign, since I had already boldly claimed to my friends that a lot of things could be prepped ahead of time without having really thought about it at all. Probably the hardest thing about preparing a Thanksgiving meal—besides the turkey, which we will return to—is coordinating the sheer number of dishes in a typical feast without a professional kitchen. I have one oven and four burners. At most, I can have 5-6 things cooking at once, which is only about half the menu. Luckily, a lot of those dishes are relatively small sides which can be made ahead of time, and they will often taste even better than if you made them on the day of the feast.
	
	Time to define the menu, keeping in mind what is easiest to make ahead of time. This is designed for serving 10-12 people at Thanksgiving, which means it serves about 20 people any other day of the year. The nice thing about this menu is that it is basically scale invariant; because half the fun of Thanksgiving is leaving with a big box of leftovers, as long as you're cooking a shit ton, you're doing it right. Force people to take their goodie bag on the way out if you have to. Remember, Thanksgiving is excessive, but that doesn't have to mean it's wasteful.
	
	Okay, enough dilly dallying, let's talk turkey.
	
	\newpage
	
	\section{The Menu}
	Here's what the final setting will look like:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Turkey
		\item \textit{(Optional)} Short ribs
		\item Gravy
		\item \textit{(Optional)} Gravy (ve)
		\item Mashed potatoes (ve)\footnote{(ve) vegetarian}
		\item Stuffing
		\item \textit{(Optional)} Stuffing (ve)
		\item Green bean casserole (ve)
		\item Roasted sweet potatoes (v)\footnote{(v) vegan}
		\item Roasted brussels sprouts (v)
		\item Salad (v)
		\item Cranberry sauce (v)
		\item Cornbread (ve)
		\item Yeast rolls (ve)
		\item Pumpkin pie (ve)
		\item Pecan pie (ve)
		\item Apple tart (ve) \TODO (yes, there will be three desserts, this is the American way)
		\item \textit{(Optional)} Pretzel salad (ve)\footnote{This one's a McKenna family recipe. It sounds like a very odd combination, but it actually goes together pretty well. I think. Maybe I just have Stockholm syndrome.}
	\end{itemize}
	
	While there is not one big vegetarian/vegan equivalent to the turkey, note that most of the sides are actually vegetarian or vegan. And everyone knows that Thanksgiving is 90\% about the sides anyways, so all your guests should have more than enough to eat regardless of their dietary restrictions.
	
	\subsection{A Note on Turkey}
	The turkey is both the most iconic Thanksgiving dish, and yet one of the least popular, in my experience. It requires the most preparation and skill, and yet can be incredibly inconsistent to make. It is the reason why there needs to be one person "in charge" of a Thanksgiving feast, as all the other dishes can theoretically be done potluck style, assuming there were no geographical constraints on where your guests are coming from.
	
	As such, I have spent significant effort trying to find the most efficient, consistent, and tasty way to prepare it. For the first couple years, I prepared it by spatchcocking to lay it flat, allowing it to cook more quickly and evenly, while taking up less of the oven. This can work pretty well, but requires a bit of skilled prep, takes up a lot of fridge space beforehand, is a bit annoying to break down, and leaves a lot of undesirable dark meat behind.
	
	So recently I've decided to just focus on the turkey breasts, i.e. the part people actually want to eat. And the best way I know to cook light poultry meat is using sous vide. You can just poach it slowly to exactly the right temperature and slice it up, easy peasy.
	
	Now, if you do not have a sous vide wand and don't want to drop around \$100 on one (although it is a great investment), you can definitely use the spatchcocking method, which requires no special equipment. It is still a good recipe; I just think it is a somewhat inefficient use of time, space, and meat.
	
	\subsection{Preparation Schedule}\label{sec:prep_schedule}
	Now for the schedule. We'll be defining T as the time everyone sits down to start eating your Thanksgiving feast. So T-1m is one month before feast day, T+30min is thirty minutes after you sit down, etc.
	
	\subsubsection{T-1m to T-1w: Pies}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pumpkin pie
		\item Pecan pie
		\item Apple pie
	\end{itemize}
	
	Pies can be made far ahead of time and actually freeze quite well, if done right. Bon Appetit gives the following \href{https://www.bonappetit.com/story/can-you-freeze-pumpkin-pie}{guidance} for pumpkin pie and pecan pie:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Bake it in a disposable aluminum pan (can be set in a regular pie pan)\footnote{I actually ended up just cooking it in a non-disposable pie pan, but it was fairly thin metal so same idea. Basically just want it to freeze quickly and evenly from all sides, so I guess just don't use a thick glass/ceramic pie pan? Or do. Who knows how much this actually matters.}
		\item Let it cool completely on the counter on a wire rack (up to three hours)
		\item Wrap the entire pie, including the tin, with three layers of plastic wrap minimizing any trapped air
		\item Wrap that tightly with aluminum foil or a resealable freezer bag
		\item Freeze completely and use within three months
		\item Thaw in fridge unwrapped and uncovered for 24 hours
		\item Let sit at room temperature for 1-2 hours
		\item Warm in 225F oven for 30 minutes
		\item Serve with whipped cream
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Taste of Home recommends \href{https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/how-to-freeze-a-pie/}{different steps} for fruit pies, but for simplicity's sake I think we can do them the same as pumpkin and pecan.
	
	Alternatively, the pies can be made on T-3d or T-2d and just never be frozen.\footnote{This is what I ended up doing, and it worked out just fine.} Keep them wrapped loosely with aluminum foil in the refrigerator. Warm in 225F oven for 30 mins.
	
	\subsubsection{T-3d: Groceries}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Buy groceries
	\end{itemize}
	
	I like to do one big day of grocery shopping, since it usually requires at least two different stores. And if you're doing this after work, you want to be set up to focus on the actual cooking for the next couple days, so best to get this out of the way ahead of time.
	
	\subsubsection{T-2d: Prep Work}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Prep turkey
		\item Prep vegetables
		\item Gravy
	\end{itemize}
	
	At this point, folks are probably coming into town soon if they haven't already. "Oh no," you think to yourself. "Thanksgiving is only two days away and all I've done is make pie." But do not fret, my child. They say our memories have a recency bias where we recall the end of something with the greatest level of detail, so those desserts will already be the saving grace of your feast.
	
	But you are right that it's time to get serious about all the other foods. This day will be all about prepping the turkey/gravy along with basic cleaning and chopping for all your other dishes. You can easily knock this out in an evening after work.
	
	While it is fairly essential that you start the turkey and gravy today, the vegetable prep could honestly be done the next day instead. It's something that \textit{can} be done two days before the feast if you want to spread out the prep work a bit more evenly across the schedule, but it's not essential. Just stick the chopped veggies in airtight containers in the fridge. I probably wouldn't prep vegetables much earlier than this, or they may start to dry out a bit.
	
	Note that some vegetables--namely the potatoes and the sweet potatoes--should not be peeled or chopped ahead of time. If they are, then they have a tendency to oxidize, which makes them taste--and more importantly, look--weird. Same goes for avocados. So just chop onions, halve your brussels sprouts, slice your tomatoes, that kind of thing. Or save it for feast day if you want to have some tasks available for others to help with.
	
	\subsubsection{T-1d: Sides and Sauces}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{(Optional)} Braise short ribs
		\item Start thawing pies
		\item Whipped cream
		\item Salad dressing
		\item Green bean casserole
		\item Cranberry sauce
		\item Stuffing
		\item \textit{(Optional)} Pretzel salad
	\end{itemize}
	
	People are here. There are airports to pick up from, hotels to check into, friends to catch up with. But you're cooking, so you can make someone else do the first two while you and a sous chef chat and cook in the kitchen. You'll probably want to take this day off if you can. It's not a ton of work to do, but with people coming into town you'll probably end up getting more distracted than you were yesterday, even if you have helping hands.
	
	\subsubsection{T-0d: Turkey and Carbs}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Cook turkey
		\item \textit{(Optional)} Reheat short ribs
		\item Mashed potatoes
		\item Cornbread
		\item Yeast rolls
		\item Roast vegetables
		\item Dress salad
		\item Warm sides
		\item Warm gravy
		\item Warm pies
	\end{itemize}
	
	Reckoning is upon us. The final stragglers have shown up, sweaters on and belt buckles loosened in anticipation of your feast. Everyone is offering to help (hopefully), but you know it would be a disaster if everyone actually tried to help.
	
	Here's the magic tip: never assign just one person to do something (unless they are a moderatly skilled chef). Instead, assign \textit{pairs} of people to tasks. Not because anything you're asking is incredibly hard, but because it's more fun to work with a friend and you're less likely to make a silly mistake if you have two pairs of eyes on it. Both of these factors mean they are less likely to be talking to \textit{you} while you are stressing out about the turkey.
	
	Here are your teams:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item You - turkey (and/or short ribs), gravy, and mashed potatoes (these are the most difficult, yet essential tasks for the day)
		\item Cornbread and yeast rolls
		\item Roasting vegetables and warming side dishes
		\item Salad, serving dishes for cold sides, and table setting
		\item (Later) warming pies
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Oven Schedule}\label{sec:oven_schedule}
	Now we need to consider the highly limiting resource of stove/oven space. I am going to assume that like most kitchens, you have four burners and one oven with at least two racks. On Thanksgiving day, here's your burner schedule:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item T-1h - T (1 large front burner): mashed potatoes
		\item T-30min - T (1 front burner): gravy
	\end{itemize}
	
	And here's your oven schedule, in Tab.~\ref{tab:oven_schedule}. Note that each cell means that item is in there from the time at the start of its row to the time at the start of the next row. So the sweet potatoes go in 90 minutes before dinner starts and come out 30 minutes before dinner starts, for instance. Similarly, the oven should be set to a new temperature the first time it appears, as highlighted in yellow. So, for example, two hours before dinner, it should be turned up to 450F.
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item[] \textbf{T-3h: set to 350F}
%		\item T-2.5h - T-2h (upper rack): yeast rolls
%		\item T-2.5h - T-2h (lower rack): cornbread
%		\item[] \hfill
%		\item[] \textbf{T-2h: set to 450F}

%		\item[] \hfill
%		\item[] \textbf{T-30min: set to 350F}
%		\item T-30min - T (upper rack): stuffing and green bean casserole
%		\item T-10min - T (lower rack): cornbread and yeast rolls
%		\item[] \hfill
%		\item[] \textbf{T: set to 225F}
%		\item T+30min - T+1h (upper rack): apple pie
%		\item T+30min - T+1h (lower rack): pumpkin pie and pecan pie
%		\item[] \hfill
%		\item[] \textbf{T+1h: turn off oven}
%	\end{itemize}

		\caption{Oven schedule for Thanksgiving Day}
		\label{tab:oven_schedule}
	\end{table}
	
	While these times are fairly accurate, they should be paired with good judgment and observation. If the brussels sprouts are looking toasty after 40 minutes, pull them out early. If the turkey is a bit thicker than expected, leave it in for 2 hours. Thanksgiving dinner is rarely right on time, and your guests would much rather have a properly cooked meal a bit later than a rushed meal right on time.
	
	The main idea behind the oven schedule is simply to group items by approximately equal temperatures and put them in an order that leads to as many things being warm and ready at the same time as possible. It also assumes that the upper rack is exposed to a bit more directional heat from above, while the lower rack is for more ambient cooking as it is protected from the top heating element by the food in the upper rack.
	
	Finally, temperature changes are not immediate, and can pose special risk when you are trying to drop the temperature. Both the stuffing and the green bean casserole are fairly wet and therefore unlikely to burn from a residual 450F oven. But this burning risk \textit{is} a part of why there is a 30 minute wait between turning the oven down to 225F and putting the pies in. We don't want to rebake them, just warm them up. Also, they don't need more than 30 minutes anyways and dinner will be at least an hour, so the break lets them be warm the soonest someone could conceivably taste them.
	
	But that all about does it as far as game day strategy goes. Now time to meet our recipes.

	\section{Recipes}
	I collected these recipes from a variety of sources: most online, some from family, a few from books, and a couple all my own. While those from other sources are mostly represented here as-is, I have added some modifications to most of them based on my own cooking experiences and some consideration of not making things more complicated than they need to be.
	
	In particular, I try to omit any trace ingredients which are not used anywhere else. I also try and adjust cooking temperatures and times to match the oven schedule (see Tab.~\ref{tab:oven_schedule}), though I never dramatically alter them solely for that purpose.
	
	\newpage
	
	\subsection{Whole Turkey (Spatchcocked)}
	Yields approximately 10 servings
	
	\begin{ingredients}
		\item 1 whole turkey
		\item 2 bunches assorted poultry herbs (e.g. rosemary, thyme, sage)
		\item 1 stick unsalted butter, softened
		\item 1/2 tsp MSG
		\item 1/4 c bacon fat (or other roasting fat for the skin)
		\item Salt and pepper
	\end{ingredients}
	
	\begin{directions}
		\item[] \textbf{Turkey Prep}
		\item Remove the turkey from packaging and drain in sink. Remove any neck or organs shoved in the cavity, setting aside for gravy.
		\item With a pair of sturdy kitchen shears, trim along both sides of the spine, from the tail to the neck, removing it entirely from the bird. Set aside for gravy.
		\item With the shears, trim the middle of the breastbone from the inside to allow the ribcage to be cracked open. Lay the bird flat on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Tuck the wing tips under the bird.
		\item Pat the turkey skin dry. Sprinkle and rub in a generous amount of salt across the skin. Rub in one bunch of the herbs too.
		\item Leave to dry brine in the fridge uncovered for 48 hours.
		\item[] \hfill
		\item[] \textbf{Compound Butter}
		\item Mince the remaining bunch of herbs.
		\item Fold the herbs into the softened butter. Add MSG and salt to taste.
		\item Wrap tightly and set aside. \label{make_ahead:whole_turkey}
		\item[] \hfill
		\item[] \textbf{Roasting}
		\item Remove the sheet from the fridge 90 minutes before starting to cook to allow to come to room temperature.
		\item Preheat oven to 450F.
		\item Brush off any salt and herbs remaining on the surface of the turkey.
		\item Open a gap in the membrane between the meat and the skin on each of the breasts and thighs. Force compound butter in each gap, spreading it out evenly with your fingers.
		\item Rub down the entire skin with the bacon grease.
		\item After the 90 minutes have elapsed, put the entire sheet with the turkey and wire rack into the oven near the middle with nothing above it. Roast until middle of breasts reach 155F, about 75 to 90 minutes. If the skin starts to get too much color, tent loosely with foil.
		\item Remove from oven and let rest on the wire rack in the rimmed baking sheet for 10 minutes.
		\item Break down the turkey into 2 wings, 6 breast/tenderloin portions, 2 thighs, and 2 drumsticks.
		\item Serve immediately with pitcher of gravy.
	\end{directions}
	
	\begin{notes}
		This is a quick cooking, fairly consistent method which gives great skin. The biggest risk is to make sure you let it come up to room temperature before putting it in the oven; otherwise you'll overcook the outside before the inside is done.
		
		The bacon grease I find gives great color and flavor for the skin with minimal risk of burning. But of course you could substitute this for beef tallow, or a high smoke point oil or something if you don't want pork in there.
		
		If you forgot to soften the butter beforehand, you can chop it into 2 tbsp cubes, put it in a small bowl, and microwave for 5 seconds at a time, mashing with a fork between the intervals until just soft enough to work.
		
		\textbf{Make Ahead:} The turkey must be prepped at least a day (preferably two) beforehand. The compound butter can also be premixed and refrigerated, just let it sit out when you take out the turkey to soften up. So potentially you can complete through step \ref{make_ahead:whole_turkey} two days beforehand.

	\subsection{Turkey Breast (Sous Vide)}
	From J. Kenji L\'{o}pez-Alt on \href{https://www.seriouseats.com/sous-vide-turkey-breast-crispy-skin-recipe-thanksgiving}{Serious Eats}
	
	Yields approximately 8 servings
	
	\begin{ingredients}
		\item 1 large, whole, skin-on, bone-in turkey breast (about 5 lbs)
		\item Salt and pepper
	\end{ingredients}
	
	\begin{directions}
		\item[] \textbf{Prep}
		\item Carefully remove turkey skin in a single piece and set aside.
		\item Remove breast meat from breastbone. Set breastbone aside for gravy.
		\item Season turkey generously with salt and pepper on all sides.
		\item Place 1 breast half, cut side facing up, on a work surface. Place second breast half facedown, so the fat end aligns with the skinny end of the first breast half. Gently form into an even cylinder.
		\item Tie turkey breast at 1 inch intervals using butcher's twine.
		\item Transfer to vacuum bag, vacuum, and seal.
		\item[] \hfill
		\item[] \textbf{Skin}
		\item Preheat oven to 400F.
		\item Spread skin evenly over a piece of parchment paper set in a rimmed baking sheet. Season generously with salt and pepper. Place a second sheet of parchment on top and carefully squeeze out any air bubbles using the side of your hand. Place a second rimmed baking sheet on top.
		\item Roast until skin is deep brown and crisp (it will crisp further on cooling), 30 to 45 minutes.
		\item Allow to cool and set aside at room temperature. \label{make_ahead:turkey_sous_vide}
		\item[] \hfill
		\item[] \textbf{Meat}
		\item Heat sous vide water bath to 145F.
		\item Cook for 2.5 hours.
		\item Remove from water bath and unseal bag. Remove butcher's twine.
		\item Cut into 1/4 to 1/2 inch slices for serving.
		\item Serve immediately with broken up pieces of roasted skin and pitcher of gravy.
	\end{directions}
	
	\begin{notes}
		This yields super juicy, flavorful turkey breast with minimal effort. It's easy to prep beforehand, cook, and slice with basically no risk. It is admittedly a little odd to have the skin separate from the turkey, but this does allow for both perfectly poached meat and perfectly crisp skin: a combination which is otherwise not easily achievable when using sous vide.
		
		Note also that the temperature and time settings for the meat are configurable based on what type of results you are looking for:
		
		\begin{tabular}{|p{2.5in}|p{1in}|p{1in}|}
			\hline
			\textbf{Final Result} & \textbf{Bath Temp} & \textbf{Cook Time} \\\hline
			Very pink, soft, extra moist & 132F & 4 hours \\\hline
			Pale pink, soft, moist  & 138F & 3 hours \\\hline
			White, tender, moist & 145F & 2.5 hours \\\hline

		\textbf{Make Ahead:} The turkey can be prepped ahead without cooking up to 5 days in advance. And the skin can be roasted up to 3 days in advance, stored loosely covered at room temperature. It can be re-crisped right before serving by putting back in a hot oven for a couple minutes. So overall, the recipe can be prepped through step \ref{make_ahead:turkey_sous_vide} ahead of time.

	\subsection{Short Ribs}
	Based on Adam Ragusea's \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFaQbSlDM0k}{YouTube video}
	
	Yields approximately 12 small servings
	
	\begin{ingredients}
		\item 1 red onion
		\item 3 carrots
		\item 2 stalks celery
		\item 3 tbsp olive oil
		\item 12 beef short ribs
		\item 1 tbsp tomato paste
		\item 1 bottle (750ml) dry white wine
		\item 1 star anise
		\item 1 tsp coriander seeds
		\item 2 tsp balsamic vinegar
		\item Salt and pepper to taste
	\end{ingredients}
	
	\begin{directions}
		\item[] \textbf{Braising}
		\item Roughly chop onion, carrots, and celery.
		\item Heat olive oil in wide braising skillet or dutch oven until shimmering over medium heat.
		\item Brown short ribs on all sides, cooking in batches if needed and transferring to a plate once complete.
		\item Add roughly chopped vegetables to pan immediately, browning for a few minutes. Add in tomato paste and let cook for another minute.
		\item Deglaze pan with bottle of wine, scraping any bits off the bottom and sides.
		\item Add anise, coriander, a couple cranks of black pepper, and a healthy pinch of salt.
		\item Add ribs back into the pan, bring to a bare simmer, and let go until exceedingly tender, about 6-8 hours, rearranging and checking periodically.
		\item Remove meat carefully and set aside. Strain braising liquid and discard the solids. Add ice cubes to the liquid and throw it in the fridge alongside the meat (separate containers) to aid in the de-fatting process.
		\item Let both dishes rest overnight in fridge. \label{make_ahead:short_ribs}
		\item[] \hfill
		\item[] \textbf{Reheating}
		\item Remove the solidified fat from the braising liquid; save for other purposes.
		\item Add remaining braising liquid to a wide pan and bring to a boil. Reduce significantly to a glaze over medium heat, about half an hour. Towards the end, stir constantly and lower heat slightly to avoid burning. It should coat the back of a spoon when fully reduced.
		\item Season glaze to taste with salt, pepper, and balsamic vinegar.
		\item Reduce heat to low. Toss meat gently in the glaze, and cover to reheat. Once warmed through, serve when ready.
	\end{directions}
	
	\begin{notes}
		This one is actually quite simple yet has some of the most incredible flavor of any protein dish. And it can basically be made ahead the day beforehand which is nice. The only thing to be careful of is to make sure you don't burn the glaze as you're reducing it. Also, be careful when seasoning to taste with the vinegar; a little can go a long way. Other than that, this is beefy, fatty, sugary candy which everyone will love.
		
		\textbf{Make Ahead:} This recipe is actually best if braised a day or two beforehand and reheated the day of. Simply follow through step \ref{make_ahead:short_ribs} ahead of time, then continue with directions on day of.

		\item Any leftover bones or meat from turkey or short ribs
		\item 1 tbsp vegetable oil
		\item 1 large yellow onion
		\item 1 large carrot

		\item 3 tbsp unsalted butter
		\item 1/4 c all-purpose flour
		\item Salt and pepper to taste
	\end{ingredients}
	
	\begin{directions}
		\item[] \textbf{Stock}
		\item Roughly break up the bones and meat, as possible.
		\item Roughly chop onion, carrot, and celery.
		\item Heat oil in Dutch oven over high heat until smoking.
		\item Add in bones, meat, and vegetables, and stir occassionally until well browned, about 10 minutes. Be careful not to burn anything.
		\item Add in stock, bay leaves, and soy sauce.
		\item Bring to boil, then reduce to simmer for 1 hour.
		\item Strain, reserving the liquid and discarding the solids. If needed, add more chicken stock to bring the total volume to 1 quart.
		\item[] \hfill
		\item[] \textbf{Roux}
		\item Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
		\item Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 3 minutes.
		\item Whisking constantly, add stock in a thin steady stream.
		\item Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thickened and reduced to about 3 cups.
		\item Season to taste with salt and pepper. \label{make_ahead:gravy}
		\item Serve slightly warm.
	\end{directions}
	
	\begin{notes}
		It is definitely worth the bit of extra effort to enrich your broth like this instead of just using store bought stuff. Really makes the flavors pop, and naturally goes with the meats.
		
		To make this vegetarian, simply exclude the bones and meat, and substitute low-sodium vegetable stock for the low-sodium chicken stock.
		
		\textbf{Make Ahead:} The gravy can be fully made up to 2 or 3 days in advance and stored in the fridge. That is, it can be made fully through step \ref{make_ahead:gravy}. Simply reheat over low heat on the stove until warm before serving on the day of.

	Based on Andrew Rea's (a.k.a. Binging with Babish) \href{https://youtu.be/ZLnWdPPJvYg?si=7kN4RYZfTfVTtFed}{YouTube video}
	
	Yields approximately 1 quart
	
	\begin{ingredients}
		\item 3 lbs Yukon Gold potatoes
		\item 3/4 c milk
		\item 3/4 c heavy cream
		\item 12 tbsp unsalted butter
		\item Salt and white pepper to taste
		\item (Optional) 1 bunch chives
	\end{ingredients}
	
	\begin{directions}
		\item Add potatoes to cold water in pot. Salt generously. Bring to boil, then cover and reduce to simmer. Cook until chunks can be pierced with paring knife with no resistance, about 10-20 minutes.
		\item Drain potatoes, put through ricer back into pot.
		\item Add milk, heavy cream, and butter. Fold in gently, trying not to overwork it.
		\item Season to taste with salt and pepper.
		\item Serve immediately.
	\end{directions}
	
	\begin{notes}
		This should be made a la minute, not prepped ahead. Since Yukon Golds are lower in starch content than Russets, it is harder to end up overworking them and making them gummy.

	Yields approximately 12 servings
	
	\begin{ingredients}
		\item 1 qt low sodium chicken stock
		\item 2 1/2 lbs sandwich bread (about 2 loaves; can use soft Italian or French instead)
		\item 8 tbsp unsalted butter
		\item 1 1/2 lbs breakfast sausage (looking for sage flavor)
		\item 1 large yellow onion
		\item 4 large ribs celery
		\item 2 cloves garlic
		\item 1 bunch fresh sage (or 2 tsp dried sage)
		\item 3 large eggs
		\item 1 bunch parsley
		\item Salt and pepper to taste
	\end{ingredients}
	
	\begin{directions}
		\item Preheat oven to 275F.
		\item Season chicken stock to taste with salt and pepper.
		\item Remove crust from bread and cut into 3/4 inch dice. Spread evenly on 2 baking sheets. Bake until completely dried, approximately 50 minutes. Rotate trays and stir bread cubes periodically.
		\item Remove bread from oven and allow to cool.
		\item Preheat oven to 350F.
		\item Finely dice onion and celery. Finely slice garlic. Finely mince sage leaves.
		\item In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium high heat until no longer foaming, but not browned, about 2 minutes.
		\item Add sausage and break up finely. Cook, stirring frequently, until little pink remains, about 8 minutes.
		\item Add onion, celery, garlic, and sage. Stir frequently until softened, about 10 minutes more.
		\item Remove Dutch oven from heat and add about half the chicken stock.
		\item In a separate bowl, whisk remaining chicken stock, eggs, and 3 tbsp chopped parsley until homogeneous.
		\item Stirring constantly, slowly pour egg mixture into sausage mixture. Gently fold in bread cubes until evenly mixed and juices absorbed into the bread.
		\item Butter a 9 by 13 dish and spread out stuffing in it. Leave surface a bit rough for better browning. Cover tightly in foil. \label{make_ahead:stuffing}
		\item Bake until center reaches 150F, about 45 minutes.
		\item Remove foil and continue baking until top is browned and crisped, about 15 minutes.
		\item Let cool for 5 minutes, sprinkle with parsley, and serve.
	\end{directions}
	
	\begin{notes}
		Stuffing can be a very personal recipe, and if someone has a good family recipe I'd say go for that. This is a pretty standard, sage focused one, but some people like a drier stuffing than this.
		
		To make this vegetarian, simply substitute low sodium vegetable stock for the chicken stock, and either exclude the sausage or replace with Impossible breakfast sausage or similar.
		
		\textbf{Make Ahead:} Follow through step \ref{make_ahead:stuffing} the day before the feast. Chill in refrigerator overnight. Allow to come to room temperature for 1 hr before continuing with steps and baking.

		This is a great elevation of what can be a very simple recipe. So if you don't have dried cranberries or goat cheese on hand, feel free to omit that and do simple roasted veggies instead. But even in that case, please do not be shy with the oil and the roasting process. The difference between delicious restaurant level sprouts and average home cooked sprouts is an obscene amount of oil. It's Thanksgiving; live a little.

		It's a salad; don't overthink it. I only include a recipe here at all to help for grocery planning purposes. So also the proportions might be a bit off; just trust your eye for what looks like too much or too little of each topping. But basically you can do whatever you want with whatever you have on hand.
		
		\textbf{Make Ahead:} The dressing can be made up to 3 days ahead of time, in which case, simply follow through step \ref{make_ahead:salad} and keep it refrigerated. Allow it to come to room temperature for at least 15 minutes before tossing just to ensure that the fats are emulsified and not solidified. Shake well beforehand too, obviously.

		\item 200 g all-purpose flour
		\item 13 g white granulated sugar
		\item 3/4 tsp kosher salt
		\item 10 tbsp unsalted butter
	\end{ingredients}
	
	\begin{directions}
		\item[] \textbf{Preparation}
		\item Add some ice to a cup of water, place in fridge.
		\item Cut 5 tbsp of butter into 1/8” squares, place in fridge.
		\item In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, and salt.
		\item With remaining 5 tbsp of butter, cut into 1/2” cubes. Add to bowl, tossing to coat, then pressing between your fingers until there are no chunks of butter larger than a pea.
		\item Add in the 5 tbsp of butter from the fridge, pressing between your fingers again until there are no chunks of butter larger than a pea and the mixture resembles a lightly damp sand.
		\item Slowly stream in 5 tbsp of the chilled water while whisking with a fork, avoiding pouring in any ice.
		\item Knead dough in bowl with your hands a few times until it comes together in a dough.
		\item Wrap tightly in plastic wrap, forcing out any air and pressing down into a 3/4” thick rectangle. Chill in fridge at least 2 hours.
		\item Take dough out of fridge and let rest on counter for 5 mins. Unwrap, and thwack it repeatedly with a rolling pin to make it more pliable. Thwack and roll it out until it is a rectangle approximately three times as long as it is wide. Fold like a trifold.
		\item Wrap tightly in plastic wrap again, and return to fridge. Let rest at least 30 mins, or up to 3 days before use. \label{make_ahead:pie_crust}
		\item[] \hfill
		\item[] \textbf{Forming}
		\item Take the dough out of the fridge and let rest on counter for 5 mins.
		\item Unwrap dough and thwack repeatedly with a rolling pin to make it more pliable. Roll it out into a circle about 13” in diameter.
		\item Drape dough over pie pan. Lift and place dough into the bottom corners; do not press it down into there, or you will risk breaking the dough.
		\item Trim any excess dough which is hanging far off the edge of the pan. Tuck the edge of the dough under itself so that it is between the lip of the pan and the crust. Form this cirulcar wall all the way around the rim.
		\item Pinch one finger between two others to make a wavy edge of the rim. Follow back pressing your thumb into each part of the wavy rim which sticks out, making sure that the dough is adhering to that rim.
	\end{directions}
	
	\begin{notes}
		You can scale this recipe up to double or triple, just divide the dough by mass. This is a nice, all-purpose, simple pie crust which you can use whether you are par-baking or not.
		
		\textbf{Make Ahead:} This can be made well ahead through step \ref{make_ahead:pie_crust}. If going to use it within 3 days, leave wrapped in fridge. If going to use within a month, wrap in 2 layers of foil and freeze, defrosting in fridge a day before use.

		\item Serve warm or at room temperature. Optionally, garnish with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
	\end{directions}
	
	\begin{notes}
		This filling attempts to add a bit more depth to the pumpkin flavor by layering it with browned butter and honey. Use a local honey if possible for bolder flavor and regional botanicals.
		
		\textbf{Make Ahead:} The pie can be baked up to 2 or 3 days ahead of time, so through step \ref{make_ahead:pumpkin_pie}. When serving, can optionally warm it in a low or cooling oven.

	\subsection{Pretzel Salad}
	Yields approximately 10 servings
	
	\begin{ingredients}
		\item 3 c crushed pretzel sticks
		\item 1 + 1/4 c white granulated sugar
		\item 2 sticks melted margarine
		\item 1 (8 oz) package softened cream cheese

	\begin{directions}

	\end{directions}
	
	\begin{notes}
		This isn't the most traditional Thanksgiving dish, but it's a staple for my family. It's the epitome of a seventies recipe: an unconventional use of Jell-O, puzzling layers, and a shockingly liberal usage of the term "salad." But it hits. It hits.
		
		\textbf{Make Ahead:} The salad can be constructed up to a day ahead and chilled in the refrigerator, so through step \ref{make_ahead:pretzel_salad}.
